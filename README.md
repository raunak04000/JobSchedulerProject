# JobSchedulerProject
This C++ program simulates a job scheduler for a supercomputer with 128 worker nodes. Jobs are queued at the master node using FCFS, smallest job first, or short duration job first policies. Worker nodes are allocated using first fit, best fit, or worst fit. Outputs include daily CPU/memory utilization and graphs.
